# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The Community is dedicated to our values of treating every individual
with respect and dignity. In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming
environment, all participants, including attendees, speakers, sponsors,
volunteers, online contributors, and IBM employees are expected to show
courtesy for each other and our community by creating a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, personal appearance, disability,
ethnicity, gender identity and expression, body size, level of experience,
nationality, race, religion, caste, or sexual identity and orientation.
Expected behavior applies to both online and offline engagement within the community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, and cultures
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants and listening
  to others
- Valuing the contributions of all participants
- Engaging in collaboration before conflict
- Pointing out unintentionally racist, sexist, casteist, or biased comments and
  jokes made by community members when they happen

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants, even when presented as
"ironic" or "joking," include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome physical contact,
  sexual attention, or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including offensive or degrading language
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of "outing" of
  any aspect of someone's identity without their consent.
- "Doxxing," Publishing screenshots or quotes, especially from identity slack
  channels, private chat, or public events, without all quoted users' explicit
  consent.
- Engaging in spamming activities, such as repeatedly sending unsolicited messages,
  LLMs (Large Language Models) output, advertisements, or promotional content to
  community members without previous IBM authorization.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The entire community is responsible for upholding the terms of the Code
of Conduct in events and spaces and reporting violations if
they see them. The internal team at IBM is ultimately responsible for
clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and enforcement, and is expected
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of
unacceptable behavior.

If a participant or contributor engages in negative or harmful behavior, IBM
will take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to
issuing warnings, expulsion from an event with no refund, deleting comments,
permanent banning from future events or online community, or calling local law
enforcement. IBM has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any
contributor or participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. 
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, 
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified 
by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at nicklas.koertge1@ibm.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

This Code of Conduct does not supersede existing IBM corporate policies, such as
the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines and IBM Business Partner Code of Conduct.
IBM employees must follow IBM's Business Conduct Guidelines. IBM's business
partners must follow the IBM Business Partner Code of Conduct. IBM employees
concerned with a fellow IBMer's behavior should follow IBM's own internal HR
reporting protocols, which include engaging the offending IBMer's manager and
involving IBM Concerns and Appeals. IBM employees concerned with an IBM
business partner's behavior should notify tellibm@us.ibm.com.
