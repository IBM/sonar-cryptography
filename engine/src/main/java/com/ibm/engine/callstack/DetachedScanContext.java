/**
 * AST-free {@link IScanContext}: retains only the file handle, path and a non-AST-pinning issue
 * reporter captured at record time, never the language-specific file scanner context (e.g. {@code
 * JavaFileScannerContext}, which holds the compilation unit). A detached recorded call carries this
 * so that replaying it does not pin the file's AST while still supporting CBOM translation and
 * cross-file SonarQube issue reporting.
 *
 * <p>{@link #reportIssue} raises the issue through {@link #issueReporter} when the location
 * implements {@link DetachedLocation} (Java's {@link DetachedSyntaxToken} or C++'s {@code
 * CxxDetachedAstNode}); if no reporter is available, or the location is not one of those AST-free
 * stand-ins, it logs and skips (the CBOM node is still produced via translation).
