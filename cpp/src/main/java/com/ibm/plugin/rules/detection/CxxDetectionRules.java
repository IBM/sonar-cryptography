/**
 * Registry of C++ cryptography detection rules.
 *
 * <p>This class aggregates all detection rules for C++ cryptographic libraries. Detection rules are
 * organized by library (e.g., OpenSSL, BoringSSL, libsodium).
 *
 * <p>To add new detection rules:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create a new package under {@code rules.detection} for the library
 *   <li>Create detection rule classes following the pattern in Java module
 *   <li>Create a {@code *DetectionRules} class that returns all rules for the library
 *   <li>Add the rules to the stream in {@link #rules()}
