/**

 * <h2>{@value #NAME}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Hybrid post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism combining X25519 (Curve25519 elliptic curve
 * Diffie-Hellman) with ML-KEM-768 (post-quantum KEM), for TLS 1.3 key exchange.
 *
 * <h3>Specification</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Other Names and Related Standards</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>TLS Named Group 0x11EC
 *   <li>Not to be confused with the earlier, distinct draft-Kyber group X25519Kyber768Draft00 (TLS
 *       Named Group 0x6399), which predates ML-KEM standardization and uses round-3 Kyber rather
 *       than the final FIPS 203 ML-KEM.
