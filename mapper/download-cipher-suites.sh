# It downloads ciphersuites.json from ciphersuite.info and regenerates
# src/main/java/com/ibm/mapper/mapper/ssl/json/JsonCipherSuites.java from it.
#
# This is NOT part of the Maven build. Run it by hand when you want to pick up
# new cipher suites, or let the update-cipher-suites workflow run it for you.
# Both files are checked into git, so the change shows up as a reviewable diff.
#
# After running this, format the generated Java file:
#     mvn -pl mapper spotless:apply
# The generator writes one entry per line and no license header. Spotless adds
# the header and the normal formatting.
