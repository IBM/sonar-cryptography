<h2>Cryptography Usage: Be careful</h2>

<p>Cryptography is a critical component of modern digital security, protecting sensitive data and communications
    from unauthorized access. However, implementing cryptographic systems correctly is notoriously challenging,
    even for experienced developers. Therefore, caution is necessary when writing code related to
    cryptography.</p>

<p>It is important that you read the documentation for the cryptographic library you are using and strictly
    adhere to the specified implementation guidelines.</p>
