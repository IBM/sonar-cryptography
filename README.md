[^1]: We only cover the BouncyCastle _light-weight API_ according to [this specification](https://javadoc.io/static/org.bouncycastle/bctls-jdk14/1.80/specifications.html)

[^2]: All packages under [`crypto`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto@go1.25.6#section-directories) are covered except `crypto/x509`

[^3]: Covers `golang.org/x/crypto/hkdf`, `golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2`, and `golang.org/x/crypto/sha3`
[^4]: C# support uses an [ANTLR v7 grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/csharp) to parse source files directly. The current csharp support only covers the language support and does not contain detection rules other than the rules used for verifying the detection engine. **This is not yet meant for active usage!** **Known limitations of the detection engine:** no cross-method variable tracking (only single-method scope), only works for c# v7, string-based matching (no type resolution)

[^5]: Covers OpenSSL EVP API (ciphers, digests, MACs, KDFs, key agreement, key generation, signatures), legacy API, SSL/TLS functions, and PRNG. Requires the [sonar-cxx](https://github.com/SonarOpenCommunity/sonar-cxx) plugin.

> [!NOTE]
> The plugin is designed in a modular way so that it can be extended to support additional languages and recognition rules to support more libraries.
>
> - To add support for another language or cryptography library, see [_Extending the Sonar Cryptography Plugin to add support for another language or cryptography library_](./docs/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md)
> - If you just want to know more about the syntax for writing new detection rules, see [_Writing new detection rules for the Sonar Cryptography Plugin_](./docs/DETECTION_RULE_STRUCTURE.md)

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> To run the plugin, you need a running SonarQube instance with one of the supported
> versions (see [Version compatibility](#version-compatibility) above), and that
> instance's own JVM must be Java 21 or newer — the plugin JAR is built for Java 21
> and a SonarQube server running on Java 17 will fail to load it. If you don't have
> a suitable instance but want to try the plugin, you can use the included Docker
> Compose to set up a development environment. See
> [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#build) for instructions.

Copy the plugin (the JAR file from the [latest releases](https://github.com/cbomkit/sonar-cryptography/releases))
to `$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins` and restart
SonarQube ([more](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup-and-upgrade/install-a-plugin/)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> C/C++ support is provided by bundling [sonar-cxx](https://github.com/SonarOpenCommunity/sonar-cxx)
> inside this plugin's JAR, the same way Java, Python and Go parsing are bundled. Do not
> also install a standalone sonar-cxx plugin on the same SonarQube instance: both would
> register the same sonar-cxx configuration properties and SonarQube will fail to start.

## Using

The plugin provides new rules regarding the use of cryptography for the supported languages.
They are grouped in the **Sonar Cryptography** rule repositories, one per language
(`sonar-java-crypto`, `sonar-python-crypto` and `sonar-go-crypto`).
If you enable the *Cryptographic Inventory (CBOM)* rule, a source code scan creates a cryptographic
inventory by creating a [CBOM](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/cbom/) with all cryptographic
assets and writing a `cbom.json` to the scan directory.

### Add Cryptography Rules to your Quality Profile

This plugin incorporates rules specifically focused on cryptography.

> To generate a Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM), it is mandatory to activate the
> *Cryptographic Inventory (CBOM)* rule.

![Activate Rules Crypto Rules](docs/images/rules.png)

The plugin currently ships these rules:

| Rule                                                     | Languages        | Contributes to the CBOM |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| *Cryptographic Inventory (CBOM)*                         | Java, Python, Go | yes                     |
| *Do not use MD5 for cryptographic purposes like hashing* | Java, Python     | no                      |

Only the *Cryptographic Inventory (CBOM)* rule writes a `cbom.json`; the other rules just raise
issues on the scanned code. Future updates may introduce additional rules to expand functionality.

### Scan Source Code

Now you can follow the [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analyzing-source-code/overview/)
to start your first scan.

### Configuration

| Property                   | Default | Scope   | Description                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sonar.cryptoScanner.cbom` | `cbom`  | Project | Filename (without extension) of the generated CBOM, written as `<name>.json`. |

The property can be set in the SonarQube UI under *Project Settings → General*, or passed to the
scanner directly:

```bash
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.cryptoScanner.cbom=my-cbom
```

### Visualizing your CBOM

Once you have scanned your source code with the plugin, and obtained a `cbom.json` file, you can use [CBOMkit](https://github.com/cbomkit/cbomkit) service to know more about it.
It provides you with general insights about the cryptography used in your source code and its compliance with post-quantum safety.
It also allows you to explore precisely each cryptography asset and its detailed specification, and displays where it appears in your code.

## Example Output

The plugin generates a `cbom.json` file in [CycloneDX CBOM format](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/cbom/). Here's an example showing detected cryptographic assets:

- **Algorithms**: Hash functions, ciphers, key exchange mechanisms with their parameters
- **Keys and secrets**: Private keys, secret keys, and other cryptographic materials
- **Evidence**: Source file locations where each asset was detected
- **Dependencies**: Relationships between cryptographic assets (e.g., a secret key depending on an algorithm)

<summary><strong>Adding packages to sonar-go-to-slang (Go support)</strong></summary>

Go cryptographic detection relies on [sonar-go-to-slang](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-go/tree/master/sonar-go-to-slang) for type resolution. The default binary includes common packages, but some cryptographic packages may require you to rebuild it with additional package export data.

### When is this needed?

If you see "undefined: \<identifier\>" errors during type checking for packages like `crypto/hmac`, `crypto/elliptic`, or `crypto/ecdsa`, you need to add the missing package export data.

### Steps to add a package

1. **Generate the package export data file** (`.o` file):

```go
//go:build ignore

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "go/importer"
    "go/token"
    "os"
    "golang.org/x/tools/go/gcexportdata"
)

func main() {
    fset := token.NewFileSet()
    imp := importer.ForCompiler(fset, "gc", nil)
    pkg, err := imp.Import("crypto/hmac")  // <-- target package
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error importing package: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    file, err := os.Create("packages/crypto_hmac.o")  // <-- output file
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error creating file: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer file.Close()
    // CRITICAL: Pass nil for fset, NOT the fset used for import
    if err := gcexportdata.Write(file, nil, pkg); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error writing export data: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Successfully created package export data for %s\n", pkg.Path())
}
```

Run with `go run gen_package.go`, then delete the script.

> **CRITICAL**: The `gcexportdata.Write` call must pass `nil` for the `fset` parameter. Passing the same fset used for import will embed absolute file paths, causing runtime errors.

2. **Check for dependencies**: Some packages depend on types from other packages. Common dependencies:

| Package | May require |
|---------|-------------|
| `crypto/hmac` | `hash` |
| `crypto/cipher` | `io` |
| `crypto/*` (most) | `io`, `hash` |

3. **Add mapping entry** to `mapping_generated.go` in alphabetical order:

```go
"crypto/hmac": "crypto_hmac.o",
```

4. **Rebuild the binary**: `./make.sh build`

### File naming convention

| Package Path | Export Data File |
|--------------|------------------|
| `crypto/hmac` | `crypto_hmac.o` |
| `crypto/elliptic` | `crypto_elliptic.o` |
| `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` | `x_crypto_bcrypt.o` |

</details>
